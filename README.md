# Medical-Data-with-GAN
## Overview
This project aims to generate synthetic medical data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for various healthcare applications. The system leverages GANs to generate realistic medical data, such as images or other health-related datasets, to augment real datasets for research and model training purposes. The generated data can help address data scarcity issues in medical research.

## Features
Synthetic Medical Data Generation: Uses GANs to generate synthetic medical data, such as X-rays, MRI scans, or patient health records.
Data Augmentation: Augments real medical datasets to increase the diversity and quantity of available data for training machine learning models.
Disease Classification: Generates labeled data to assist in training models for disease classification, e.g., cancer detection, heart disease prediction.
Anomaly Detection: Generates both normal and anomalous medical data for training anomaly detection models.
Privacy Preservation: Synthetic medical data can be used to protect patient privacy while still providing valuable information for research and analysis.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Generative Adversarial Networks: DCGAN, WGAN, or StyleGAN (depending on the project goals)
Medical Imaging: OpenCV, Pillow for image processing
Web Technologies: Flask or Streamlit for data visualization and dashboard (optional)
Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (if needed for storing generated data)
